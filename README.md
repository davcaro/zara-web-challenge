## Coding challenge Requirements

The test consists of a web application to view and search for Marvel characters. The application should have three screens:

- **Main screen**: It must display the list of the first 50 Marvel characters, allow searching by name (managed by API) and add characters to favorites.
- **Favorites screen**: It must show the list of characters that the user has added to favorites and allow searching by name.
- **Character details screen**: It must show all the information about the character and the list of comics in which it appears and allow to add the character to favorites.

It must also have a header that allows navigating to the main screen and the favorites screen, as well as displaying a counter of the characters saved in favorites.<br/>
In addition, it is required to implement tests to check the correct behavior of the application, to have a responsive design and to have a correct accessibility.
